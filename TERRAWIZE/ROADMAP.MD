## High-Level Overview

**Expertosy Web Recommendation System** is a platform that leverages **OpenAI**’s chat-based models to analyze a product or category () and guide users through a structured questionnaire. The system then generates:

1. **Relevant Factors and Categories**: The AI determines the most important attributes (like capacity, brand reputation, and safety features).
2. **Comprehensive Questionnaire**: It creates a set of questions, each with multiple-choice options that incorporate a pre-defined or AI-generated cost breakdown.
3. **User Interaction**: Users select answers from the multiple-choice options on the website.
4. **Personalized Recommendation**: The system sends the user’s selections to the AI, which then returns a product recommendation (or set of recommendations) tailored to the preferences chosen.

The key innovation is that the entire process is done on a **web interface**, allowing for a more **intuitive** and **accessible** experience than a CLI application. This approach can be extended far beyond s—any product or service that has multiple features or factors to consider can be recommended using the same principles.

## Core Features

### AI-Powered Factor Generation
- The backend calls OpenAI to **generate factors** relevant to the user’s query.  
  Example: If the user wants “recommend a ,” the AI might generate factors like **Capacity**, **Output Power**, **Number of Ports**, **Charging Speed**, etc.
- These factors serve as the **foundation** for the rest of the questionnaire.

### AI-Generated Questionnaires
- Once the factors are known, the system **instructs the AI** to create a questionnaire.  
- The questionnaire is structured so that each factor is turned into a **multiple-choice question** (for example, “What capacity do you prefer?” with four options).  
- The questions are **rich in context**, often including cost breakdowns and additional relevant details.

### Cost Breakdown Integration
- The app can embed **cost analysis** into each question.  
  For instance, “10,000 mAh capacity ranges from $20–$30,” “20,000 mAh capacity ranges from $30–$50,” etc.  
- This gives the user immediate insight into how their preferences might affect budget or product availability.

### Personalized Recommendations
- After the user completes all questions, the system **aggregates** these answers.  
- The application sends a final request to the AI, describing the user’s preferences and asking for a **comprehensive recommendation**.  
- The AI may return:
  - A single product recommendation
  - A list of top picks
  - A pros-and-cons breakdown, depending on how you design the prompt

### Detailed Data Storage and Export
- The application **stores** all generated data:
  - Factors
  - Categories
  - Questionnaire text
  - User’s answers
  - Final recommendations
- This data is then optionally exported to:
  - **Text files** (for reading or debugging)
  - **Excel spreadsheets** (to maintain a structured record for further analysis)

## Advanced Architecture

### Backend Overview
1. **Server Environment**: Typically powered by Python (e.g., **Flask** or **FastAPI**), though any modern server framework could be used.
2. **OpenAI Integration**:  
   - A specialized service class (like `ExpertosyRecommendationEngine`) handles all calls to the OpenAI API.  
   - The server uses environment variables (`OPENAI_API_KEY`) to authenticate.
3. **Database or Filesystem**:  
   - Results and logs can be stored in a relational database, NoSQL store, or simply the filesystem (like saving to `results/`).
4. **Session Management**:  
   - Each user either has a session or a unique token to ensure the questionnaire is tracked properly.
5. **Security**:  
   - Access tokens, rate limiting, or other protective measures can be integrated if needed.

### Frontend Overview
1. **Responsive UI**:  
   - Built using a framework like **React**, **Vue**, or **Angular**, or even server-side templating.
   - Mobile-friendly design ensures the user can answer from any device.
2. **Dynamic Questionnaire Rendering**:  
   - The frontend receives the questionnaire data (list of questions and multiple-choice options) from the backend and **displays** them in a well-structured format.
3. **Real-Time Feedback**:  
   - Each time the user selects an answer, it can be stored in local state or posted to the backend in real time.
4. **Animated Progress**:  
   - Show progress bars or step indicators, so the user knows how many questions remain.

### Data Flow
1. **User’s Query**: The user states “I want a recommendation for X.” The server calls OpenAI to generate factors and categories.  
2. **Questionnaire Generation**: The server requests a questionnaire from OpenAI, embedding cost breakdowns.  
3. **Frontend Display**: The frontend receives the questionnaire and renders each question with multiple-choice options.  
4. **User Answers**: The user makes selections. The frontend sends these selections back to the backend.  
5. **AI Recommendation**: The backend passes all selected answers to OpenAI for a final recommendation, which is returned to the user.  
6. **Storage**: The system saves all relevant data to text files, Excel, or a database.

## User Flow on the Website

### Landing Page
- **Description**: A simple, visually appealing page welcoming users to the recommendation system.  
- **Input Field**: A text box or dropdown where the user can specify the product or category they want a recommendation for (e.g., “,” “laptop,” “headphones,” etc.).  
- **Start Button**: Upon clicking, the user’s query is sent to the backend, which begins generating factors.

### Questionnaire Page
1. **Dynamic Loading**: The page may show a spinner as the AI is preparing the question list.  
2. **Question Display**: Once questions are ready, they appear in an organized layout. For instance:  
   - Q1: Capacity  
     - 1. 10,000 mAh ($20-$30)  
     - 2. 20,000 mAh ($30-$50)  
     - 3. 30,000 mAh ($50-$80)  
     - 4. 50,000 mAh ($80-$120)
   - Q2: Output Power  
     - 1. 5W ($10-$20)  
     - 2. 10W ($15-$30)  
     - 3. 18W ($30-$50)  
     - 4. 30W ($50-$100)  
   - … and so on.  
3. **Answer Selection**:  
   - Each question is represented by **radio buttons** or **select dropdowns** for easy picking.  
   - Potentially include **tooltips** or **hover info** to explain terms like “mAh,” “W,” or “fast charge.”  
4. **Next/Previous**: Provide navigation so the user can move back to change answers if needed.  
5. **Progress Bar**: A visual element to show how many questions remain.

### Results and Recommendations Page
1. **Summary of Choices**:  
   - List the user’s chosen answers, so they can review (for example, “You chose 20,000 mAh, 10W output, 2 ports, brand with good reviews,” etc.).  
2. **Final Recommendation**:  
   - Display the product or service recommended by the AI.  
   - Possibly show multiple recommended items or a “best match” plus “runner-up” options.  
   - Provide an explanation: “We recommend the Anker X123 because it matches your capacity, output power, and budget.”  
3. **Additional Actions**:  
   - **Download**: The user can download a copy of the recommendation or the entire results in a text or PDF format.  
   - **View Excel**: If the system compiles an Excel sheet with all the data, let the user export or view it.  
   - **Start Over**: A button to begin a new query.

## Scalability and Enhancements

### Advanced Customization
- **User Profile**: If users can log in, they might store their past preferences or maintain a profile that influences future recommendations.  
- **Custom Weights**: Some advanced users may want to weight certain factors more heavily (e.g., “I value capacity much more than brand reputation”).

### Tracking and Analytics
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Track how often certain answers are chosen, the average recommended price range, and more.  
- **User Behavior Logging**: Understand which questions lead users to switch answers or which question is the biggest deciding factor.

### Multi-Query Support
- **Comparisons**: The app might allow users to compare different categories side by side.  
- **Multi-Product Lines**: For instance, if someone is searching for both a  and a set of headphones, the system can store multiple sets of preferences or run multi-step recommendations.
